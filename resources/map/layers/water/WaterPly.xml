				<procdesc>EDMD acquired new aerial photography of the District of
Columbia in the spring of 1999 prior to the emergence of
deciduous foliage.  Aerial photography was exposed at an
altitude of 7,200' AMT using a Wild RC-20 or RC-30
camera system that is equipped with forward motion
compensation and a 12" (300mm) focal length lens cone
600'.  The
flight design developed in 1995 was duplicated.  The
design calls for an approximate total of 1,000 frames in 24
North-South oriented flight lines.  Forward overlap between
frames within each flight line was 80%.  Sidelap between
adjacent flight lines was 48%.  Aerial photography
was captured in natural color using Kodak Aerocolor
negative film type 2445.  Aerial photography was not
exposed using airborne GPS due to the existence of an
existing control network created in 1995.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>Planimetric Data Capture and Edit
The following is a step-by-step description of the steps
involved in the collection of planimetric features from the
aerial photography.
Step 1	Planimetric data is captured within each flightline
proceeding in an North-South or South-North progression.
The diapositives and contact prints for each of the priority
production areas are assigned to photogrammetric
technician for data collection.  All planimetric data is
collected using Wild BC-2 first order analytical
stereoplotting systems.
Step 2	The photogrammetric supervisor establishes the
data collection conventions to be used for data capture.
All planimetric data is initially collected in the Microstation
environment.  The photogrammetric supervisor establishes
data collection conventions and establishes the
data-layering schema, global origin and working units to be
used for data collection.  These preferences are
programmed into Microstation to ensure continuity.
Step 3	Planimetric data is collected and saved to the
designated network subdirectory.  As data is collected, the
technician reviews the planimetric information on the
stereoplotter monitor to ensure that collection is complete
and that the required features are depicted and assigned
to the correct layer in the CAD design file.
EDMD has developed an in-house CAD application to
prepare the planimetric features for conversion to polygons
once the data has been migrated into ARC/INFO.  The
technician collects planimetric features in a clockwise
direction, which create centroids at the completion of each
line.  Each of these centroids delineates the outer
boundary of a polygon.  In areas where a line creates a
boundary for multiple features (edge of pavement, edge of
parking lot, edge of parking lot-edge of building), the line
segment is duplicated and assigned to all layers of the file
that contain the effected features.
Step 4	The photogrammetric technician completes
information for inclusion in the metadata.
Step 5	As stereo models are completed on the analytical
stereoplotter, the cartographic editor copies a number of
files pertaining to a block of map coverage and merges the
data sets into map-sheet-oriented format.  The merged data
is inspected for compliance with the database design.
Criteria for inspection include correct layer assignment, line
color, and line style.
The CAD application has incorporated quality control
functions, which add temporary symbols to indicate the
necessary duplication of line segments to complete
polygon closure in all affected features.  The editor makes
any corrections or additions interactively.  If necessary,
lines are snapped to ensure closure.
Step 5A	The cartographic editor translates the
ARC/INFO coverages of the existing planimetric data that
was produced as part of Task 2 and the State Department
modification into a CAD readable format.  The line work
between the new mapping and existing mapping is
tied together to ensure compliance with the contract
requirements for topology.
Step 6	As coverage areas are completed; the editor
informs the ARC/INFO supervisor that data is ready for
conversion and final quality control.  The completed vector
files are copied to a designated network subdirectory.
In order to avoid the possibility that incomplete or unedited
data sets are mistakenly imported during production, a
separate network subdirectory is used for the data at each
stage in the production process.  The network subdirectory
structure is standardized for every project.
Step 7	Edited data sets are translated into ARC/INFO
and polygon topology is created.  The process used to
create the final ARC/INFO coverages is described in the
Attribute Accuracy Report Section.
Step 8	The cartographic technician records any
pertinent dates or other information for completion of
metadata.
Plots
EDMD developed an ARC/INFO AML to generate hard
copy plots of the 1995 digital orthophotos as part of Task
3.  This routine will be modified to accommodate plotting of
the planimetric and/or topographic data.  The format will
retain the graphic design that was developed in 1999.
Design elements of the format and surround as well as the
planimetric/topographic mapping will be fully compliant with
the requirements stated in the contract modification.
Upon completion of the initial editing and conversion of the
data to ARC/INFO, EDMD will prepare a set of bond paper
plots.  Polygon features will be color coded for cartographic
clarity and will enable NCPC quality inspectors to verify that
no polygons overlap or are miscoded.  A copy of the digital
data that corresponds to the plots will be included to allow
inspectors to review digital data content.
NCPC will inspect the plots and mark any errors, omissions
or mistakes on the plots.  The edited plots are returned to
EDMD for correction.  Once the data has been corrected,
EDMD will produce a total of 3 sets of inkjet mylar plots
containing the planimetric data only in the approved format
surround.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>SIS Automation
EDMD will submit a copy of the edited planimetric data to
Dewberry &amp; Davis for the automation of the street inventory
system.  It is anticipated that there will be a delay of 4
weeks between the completion of planimetric mapping and
completion of the corresponding SIS database.  The
following is a description of the process that will be used to
Step 1	EDMD, D&amp;D, NCPC and designated
representatives of DC DPW will meet to accomplish the
--Presentation of the listing of government furnished material that are needed by D&amp;D
--Set up conventions for creation of intersection nodes
--Set up conventions for attribution
--Set up conventions for reporting of omissions, errors or other QC issues in the SIS data to DC DPW and NCPC
These conventions will be tested and validated during the
pilot project.
Step 2 	For each contiguous block of centerlines, D&amp;D
will extend curb lines through street intersections and
generate intersection nodes consistent with DPW
guidance established in step 1.
Step 3	Where two or more nodes are present that
comprise a single intersection (e.g., two multi-street
centerlines that intersect with four nodes), D&amp;D will cluster
those nodes and identify an intersection centroid for linking
SIS files of street names, address ranges, etc.
Step 4	D&amp;D will overlay the SIS files and conflate them
to match the centerlines, nodes, and multi-node centroids.
Because of anticipated SIS shortcomings, such as
identified in D&amp;D's Washington GIS, Pilot Project Final
Report, dated June 30, 1997, this conflation will normally
be performed manually.
Step 5	D&amp;D will overlay the georeferenced SIS files
over 1995 digital orthophotos and copies of the 1999
planimetric mapping provided by EDI to ensure that the
new SIS files satisfy positional accuracy requirements.
Step 6	D&amp;D will deliver one set of ARC/INFO export
files (.e00) on CD-ROM to NCPC and will conduct a
demonstration, on DPW equipment (PC ArcView), that the
current INFO attributes work with the revised street
centerline file coverage.
Step 7	D&amp;D will conduct on-site field verification surveys
(1)
direction (2) street name, (3) address ranges for each street
segment between cross-streets, (4) number of
lanes, (5) directionality of lane, and (6) lane usage.
Step 8	Addition of streets not digitized by EDMD.
Step 9	Correction of address ranges where streets are
bisected by added streets.
Step 10	Correction of other SIS data errors observable
from "windshield surveys."
Step 11	Provision of discrepancy lists, to NCPC, where
SIS street names differ from those posted on street signs.
D&amp;D will not change the SIS files to match street signs that
are verified in the field.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>Extracted from Librarian using Simple option into coverage, then imported to geodatabase. Removed all voids and empty polygons from shape. The NCPC ArcInfo Librarian dataset is made up of 350 tiles.  Over 29 data layers were extracted from the Librarian using the following procedures (see planimetric process.xls).

1) In order to withdraw seamless data out of Librarian an extraction polygon must be created.  The extraction polygon must encompass the span of all the tiles.  Extracting the index layer of the librarian and dissolving the boundaries of the 350 polygons into 1 polygon accomplished this task.

The procedures for creating the extraction polygon are as follows:
¨	Extract the index layer using Arcview and converting the theme into a shapefile.
¨	Create a field within the feature table for which the individual polygon can dissolve from by assigning a value of 1 in it for all records.
¨	Using the geo-processor extension option, the shapefiles' records were dissolved into 1 poly by dissolving the records with the common field.
¨	The polygon theme was then transformed into a polygon coverage through ArcToolbox.
¨	Once the extraction polygon was prepped, data layer extraction was completely done in the ArcInfo environment.

Setting the ArcInfo Environment.
1)	Launch the ArcInfo Command Prompt window.
2)	Set the working directory ( arc:  w d:\workspace\extraction)
3)	Set the precision for the environment and to all processes done in the ArcInfo Session.  ( arc:  Precision double double  )
4)	Enter the librarian module  (arc:  Librarian)
5)	Set the library volume (Librarian:  library ncpc)
6)	Set the extraction polygon coverage (Librarian: setcover index)
7)	Set the layer to be extracted  (Librarian : setlayer air)
8)	Enter the command line to extract.  (Librarian:  extract OPTION # clip)

The extract command has a few options that can be set when extracting different types of layers such as polygons, lines, and points.
Extract DISSOLVE is used for polygon layers only because it will extract the layer and merge the polygons where they are split by index tiles, thus removing additional polys.  The ArcInfo commands involved with this option are Clip Dissolve and Build.

For Line and Point layers, the SIMPLE option was used to extract.  The topology is left unbuilt when the information is extracted.  Reason being that if the tile lines segment lines and create pseudo nodes.  The user-id from the ArcInfo table were used to unsplit the lines and remove the pseudo node.  Once that is done, the coverage can rebuild the topology.

Data Improvements
The line data coverages had tiles with some additional pseudo nodes.  The pseudo nodes were probably created as a result of different digitizing techniques (neither right nor wrong).  Using the Unsplit command we were able to clean these areas up by unsplitting only lines that had the same dxf-layer value and that shared a node.

Data cleanup
The polygon coverages extracted contained void (coded 9999) areas.  In Arcedit, these ambiguous features were removed with the following technique.
Arc:  ae  (enter arcedit module)

Arcedit: ec coverage  (enter the editing coverage)

Arcedit:  ef poly (enter the feature to be edited)

Arcedit: select for dxf-layer = 'VOID'  (querying for features in the attribute table under dxf-layer that contains attribute labeled VOID)

Arcedit:  delete (delete the features found)

Arcedit: Save  (save the changes)

The line coverages had the neatlines using the same method where the dxf-layer had values = 'NEATLINE'</procdesc>

				<procdesc>Enhancements to the original coverage:
The original WaterPly coverage was enhanced to provide a more accurate
outline of the southwestern shape of the Potomac River. Along the river's boundary in
the southwest quadrant of DC, segments were added to show a more
accurate outline. Prior to these enhancements, the river's boundary did
not reflect its western edge correctly as it followed the tile boundary. The enhanced shoreline now includes portions of the river originally outside the designated tile boundary.
To achieve this enhancement, the shoreline was re-digitized.</procdesc>

Edit/Quality Control Process in ARC/INFO

The final topological structure is created and verified using ARC/INFO's Map Librarian functionality.  In general, use of a map library ensures overall compliance with defined database structures and conventions, and, for this specific project, guarantees adherence to the database structure and conventions.  In addition, in-house-developed ARC/INFO routines are employed for translation of vector data from a CAD to GIS environment.  These routines maintain coding of all CAD data, construct both topologically clean and topologically structured data sets, and combine or separate data into the correct user-defined output data sets.  For this project, for example, all CAD data are translated to ARC/INFO coverages while eliminating topological errors such as overshoots and undershoots.  EDMD GIS division verifies that all vector data produced for the project meets the Graphic Data Standards, as outlined in the modification of Task 4.  



A combination of automated procedures and interactive processes are used. The following is a listing of AML Default Routines:

QC_PROC.aml
This routine will run all of the following AMLs.  The &amp;run qc_proc.aml &lt;library&gt; &lt;tile&gt; &lt;layer&gt; 

&lt;library&gt; - The name of the map library (i.e. NCPC) 

&lt;tile&gt; - the tile within the map library upon which the AMLs are to run

&lt;layer&gt; - the layer defined for the map library (i.e. roads)



General Data Set Verification

QC_DATAPROJ.aml
This routine checks correctness of all projection parameters.  It verifies map projection, projection zone, datum and projection units.

QC_DATAEXT.aml
This routine checks if all data in the selected data set are within the corresponding map sheet boundaries.

QC_CORN.aml
This routine checks if corner coordinates of the selected data set coincide with corner coordinates of the corresponding map sheet.

QC_DATATOL.aml
This routine checks mapping tolerances.  Mapping tolerances implicitly define accuracy and precision of vector data.



Attribute Verification

QC_FEATNODE.aml, QC_FEATPNTS.aml, QC_FEATLINE.aml, QC_FEATPOLY.aml
These routines check the field definitions of the selected data set and data type.

QC_ATTRPNTS.aml, QC_ATTRLINE.aml, QC_ATTRPOLY.aml
These routines check the attribute codes of all features in the selected data set against the range of possible attribute codes defined in the database.



Topological Consistency Verification

QC_DATAEDGE.aml
This routine checks for spatial mismatches of linear features among adjacent map sheets.  It displays any mismatch.

QC_ATTREDGE.aml
This routine checks for attribute mismatches of polygon features among adjacent map sheets.

QC_DANGINT.aml
This routine displays intersections of features within a data set such as contour data.  Intersections of contour features indicate errors as contours are by definition non-intersecting isometric.  This routine also displays any terminal node that is not connected to any other feature.  



The following is a description of the steps undertaken to inspect and verify the quality of the planimetric data.

Step 1	EDMD prepares an ARC/INFO map library using the database design as developed by Dewberry &amp; Davis dated June 30, 1997.  Using an ARC/INFO map library, any inconsistencies in the database are immediately apparent when loading or modifying the digital planimetric data.

Step 2	Compiled data are translated to the appropriate ARC/INFO coverages and inserted into the map library.  The translation procedures ensure that all codes are within the range of possible domain values.  Illogical coding or configuration of features such as roads within buildings is immediately flagged.

Step 3	Using the Map Librarian functionality, routines (i.e., Arc Macro Language - AML) can be automatically applied to the entire database using the Map Librarian VISIT command.  Similarly, other layers are validated with the appropriate routines.

Step 4	In an interactive session, using ARC/EDIT, each map library tile, including all the associated layers, is verified by an editor.  Verification consists of checking spatial and attribute data.  In this session, topological inconsistencies are highlighted, for example, dangling arcs, missing label points, etc.  Identification of missing features or features with incorrect shape can also easily be identified through use of the 1995 orthophotos that reside in the image catalog.

Step 5	Final quality control is performed in an ArcView session, again using the map library.  Any missing features will be identified during this step. 

Generally, steps 1, 4, and 5 involve interactive quality control steps, while steps 2 and 3 are based on automated quality assurance.  Step 5, as a final quality control step, includes verification of vector data to hardcopy maps.</logic><complete>Validated by source and/or responsible agency. The photogrammetric mapping is guaranteed to meet National Map Accuracy standards for digital mapping at a scale of 1 inch to 83.33 feet, which calls for 90% of well defined points to fall within 33.3 inches of true position horizontally. This does not apply to hidden features, which were inferred.</complete><cloud>0</cloud></dataqual>
